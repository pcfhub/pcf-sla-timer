/*
 * The platform, stood in for: everything a field control reads off `context`,
 * built from a set of switches.
 *
 * Loaded by both `harness.html` in a browser and `smoke.js` in Node, which is
 * why it attaches to `window` *and* assigns `module.exports` and requires
 * neither to exist. One definition of the host is the point — a browser mock
 * and a Node mock that drifted apart would let the same control pass one and
 * fail the other for reasons that are about the mocks.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Why this exists when `npm start` already hosts a field control.**
 *
 * `pcf-start` gives you a property panel and a real render, and for the happy
 * path it is the better tool — use it. What it cannot put the control into is
 * every state a form can:
 *
 *   - **field-level security** — `security.readable === false` is what a user
 *     denied read access gets, and it arrives as `raw === null`, which is
 *     indistinguishable from "empty" to a control that does not check;
 *   - **platform validation** — `error` / `errorMessage`, set by a business
 *     rule the harness has no way to run;
 *   - **a host theme** — `fluentDesignLanguage.isDarkTheme`, published by a
 *     model-driven form and by nothing else;
 *   - **the canvas/model-driven split** — `attributes` is column metadata, and
 *     a canvas app has none. Every `?.` in the control is about this, and
 *     `npm start` only ever shows you one side of it.
 *
 * Those are the branches nobody exercises and customers find. Here they are
 * checkboxes.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **A stub must never be more capable than the thing it stands in for.** Where
 * the platform withholds something, this withholds it: `security` is
 * `undefined` on a column with no field-level security, `attributes` is
 * `undefined` on canvas, `fluentDesignLanguage` is `undefined` on a host that
 * publishes no theme. Filling those in "so the control has something to read"
 * is how a control that cannot work on a real form passes every local check.
